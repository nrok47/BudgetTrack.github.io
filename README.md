## Deployment

The project is deployed to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). The workflow builds the app from the `main` branch and publishes the `dist` output automatically.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Pages set to use **GitHub Actions** (Repo Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions)
- `dist/` is ignored (see `.gitignore`) so only source code is versioned

### 2. Automatic Deployment Flow

1. Push commits to `main`
2. Workflow runs: checkout → install (`npm ci`) → build (`npm run build`) → upload artifact → deploy
3. Pages URL appears in the deployment job output
git push origin main
```
 
```bash
git checkout main
npm install
npm run dev
# After changes
git commit -am "feat: update"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Manual Fallback (Emergency)

If Actions are unavailable and you need a quick manual publish:

```bash
npm run build
git checkout -B gh-pages
rm -rf *
cp -r dist/* .
git add .
git commit -m "manual: publish"
git push -f origin gh-pages
```

Switch Pages source to `gh-pages` temporarily. Revert to Actions afterward.

### 5. Cleaning Up Legacy Branch

If you previously used a `gh-pages` branch and no longer need it:

```bash
git branch -D gh-pages            # local
git push origin --delete gh-pages # remote
```

### 6. Common Issues

- 404 assets: ensure `vite.config.ts` `base` is `/`
- Blank page: confirm workflow succeeded; check console for blocked scripts
- Large bundle: consider dynamic imports / code splitting

### 7. Changing Node Version

Update `node-version` in `deploy.yml` if you adopt a newer runtime.

### 8. Environment Variables

Add secrets via Repo Settings → Secrets and reference them in workflow steps (none required currently).
